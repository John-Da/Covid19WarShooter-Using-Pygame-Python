# Covid19 War Shooter

Covid19 War is a retro-style arcade shooter developed in Python using the Pygame library. The game challenges players to survive against continuously spawning waves of enemies while collecting recovery points to maintain health. The gameplay emphasizes fast movement, continuous shooting, and increasing difficulty through a progressive wave system.

## 2. Game Features
Retro arcade-style gameplay
Full 4-directional movement with simultaneous shooting
Progressive wave-based enemy spawning
Randomized scoring rewards
Randomized health recovery system

Score tracking system

## 3. Gameplay Mechanics
### 3.1 Player Movement
The player can move freely in four directions:
Left
Right
Forward
Backward
Movement can be performed simultaneously with shooting, allowing continuous combat engagement.

### 3.2 Shooting System
The player continuously fires projectiles to eliminate enemies. Projectile collisions with enemies remove them from the screen and award points.

### 3.3 Wave System
The game progresses through waves, where:
Each new wave spawns more enemies than the previous one.
Enemy density and difficulty gradually increase, making survival more challenging.

## 4. Scoring System
Each enemy defeated grants a random score reward:
Minimum score: 10 points
Maximum score: 120 points
This randomness encourages replayability and dynamic gameplay outcomes.



## 5. Recovery System
Health recovery items occasionally appear in the game. When collected, they restore a random amount of health:
Minimum recovery: 2 points
Maximum recovery: 15 points
Players must balance aggressive gameplay with survival by collecting recovery items when necessary.
